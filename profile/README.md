# Adarium Labs

> **Building formally proven, modern tooling for Ada/SPARK**

## 🎯 Our Mission

Adarium Labs develops open-source libraries, frameworks, and tools for the Ada/SPARK ecosystem, with a focus on formal verification and modern developer experience. Our goal is to provide production-ready, formally proven software that serves both safety-critical industries (aerospace, railway, automotive) and mainstream developers.

## 🔬 About

Founded by a PhD in static code analysis for Ada, Adarium Labs brings academic rigor and industry expertise to modernize the Ada/SPARK tooling landscape. We believe that formal verification and developer productivity can coexist.

## 🚀 Current & Planned Projects

### In Development
- **CLI Framework** - A formally proven command-line interface framework for Ada, inspired by Clap (Rust) and Cobra (Go), featuring subcommands, typed arguments, auto-completion, help generation, and more.

### Roadmap
- **DNS Server** - A formally proven DNS server implementation in Ada/SPARK with support for modern protocols (DoH, DoT, DoQ)
- **QUIC Implementation** - A formally verified QUIC protocol implementation for safety-critical applications
- **Web Framework** - A modern, formally proven web framework with strongly-typed APIs and edge computing support
